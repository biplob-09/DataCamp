""" Concatenate dataframes
In this exercise, youâ€™ll practice concatenating records by creating a dataset of the 100 highest-rated cafes in New York City according to Yelp.
APIs often limit the amount of data returned, since sending large datasets can be time- and resource-intensive. The Yelp Business Search API limits the results returned in a call to 50 records. However, the offset parameter lets a user retrieve results starting after a specified number. By modifying the offset, we can get results 1-50 in one call and 51-100 in another. Then, we can append the dataframes.
pandas (as pd), requests, and json_normalize() have been imported. The 50 top-rated cafes are already in a dataframe, top_50_cafes."""


# Add an offset parameter to get cafes 51-100
params = {"term": "cafe", 
          "location": "NYC",
          "sort_by": "rating", 
          "limit": 50,
          "offset":50}

result = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers, params=params)
next_50_cafes = json_normalize(result.json()["businesses"])

# Concatenate the results, setting ignore_index to renumber rows
cafes = pd.concat([top_50_cafes,next_50_cafes],ignore_index=True)

# Print shape of cafes
print(cafes.shape)
